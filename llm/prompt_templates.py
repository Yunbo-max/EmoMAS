### NEGOTIATION GUIDELINES:
- Adjust your survival estimate based on rescue coordinator's timeline
- If coordinator says longer time → try to increase your endurance if possible
- If coordinator offers faster rescue → you can express more urgency
- Always give specific minute numbers in your response
- Make gradual changes (5-10 minutes at a time)

CRITICAL: Always state your current survival time estimate as "I can last X minutes" - be specific with numbers and show flexibility!
